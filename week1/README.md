# Week 1: The AI Landscape and Generative AI

Welcome to Week 1! Have you ever wondered how ChatGPT writes stories, how DALL-E creates art, or how your phone finishes your sentences? This week, we’ll explore the magic behind these tools and why learning generative AI is one of the most exciting skills for the future.

>  Imagine a computer that can write a poem, paint a picture, or even invent a new recipe. Generative AI is like a digital artist and storyteller rolled into one!

## 1. What is Artificial Intelligence?
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the science of making computers and machines that can perform tasks that usually require human intelligence. These tasks include understanding language, recognizing images, making decisions, and more.

**Analogy:** Think of AI as a super-smart assistant that can learn from experience, just like a human, but much faster!

**Examples of AI in daily life:**
- Voice assistants (like Siri, Alexa)
- Recommendation systems (Netflix, YouTube)
- Self-driving cars

## 2. What is Generative AI?
Generative AI is a branch of AI that can create new content—such as text, images, music, or code—rather than just analyzing or acting on existing data.

**Why learn GenAI?**
- 80% of organizations are expected to use generative AI by 2026 (Gartner).
- Generative AI is already transforming jobs in art, writing, marketing, science, and more.
- The global market for generative AI is projected to reach $66 billion by 2030.

**Key idea:** Generative AI learns from huge amounts of data and then uses that knowledge to generate something new that didn’t exist before.

**Analogy:** If traditional AI is like a judge (deciding if an email is spam), generative AI is like an artist (creating a brand new email, story, or image).

**Examples:**
- ChatGPT writes essays, stories, or answers questions.
- DALL-E and Stable Diffusion create original images from text prompts.

## 3. How Does Generative AI Work?
Generative AI uses special models called neural networks. These models are trained on huge datasets (like books, images, or code) and learn patterns in the data.

**Analogy:** Training a generative AI is like teaching a child to draw by showing them thousands of pictures. Eventually, the child can draw something new by combining what they’ve seen.

**Popular generative models:**
- **Large Language Models (LLMs):** Generate text (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini, Llama-2)
- **Diffusion Models:** Generate images (e.g., Stable Diffusion, DALL-E)
- **GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks):** Used for images, video, and more

**How training works:**
1. The model sees lots of examples (e.g., millions of sentences or images).
2. It learns the patterns and relationships in the data.
3. When given a prompt, it generates new content based on what it has learned.

ChatGPT reached 100 million users in just 2 months—faster than TikTok or Instagram!

## 4. Where Does Generative AI Fit?
- **Discriminative Models:** Like a detective, they predict labels or categories (e.g., is this email spam?).
- **Generative Models:** Like a storyteller, they create new data similar to what they were trained on (e.g., write a poem, generate an image).

## 5. Applications and Risks of Generative AI

**Applications:**
- Chatbots (e.g., ChatGPT)
- Code generation (e.g., GitHub Copilot)
- Marketing content, design, and art
- Healthcare reports
- Creating synthetic data for research

**Fact:** Generative AI can write code, design logos, compose music, and even help doctors summarize patient records.

**Risks and Challenges:**
- Hallucinations (AI makes things up)
- Bias in outputs
- Copyright and plagiarism
- Misinformation

## 6. Conceptual Overview of Generative Models

Generative models learn the probability distribution of data, allowing them to “sample” or create new examples.

**Analogy:** If a discriminative model is like a bouncer checking IDs at a club, a generative model is like a DJ creating new music for the crowd.

**Language Models:**
- Predict the next word (token) given the previous context.
- **Parameters:**
	- **Temperature:** Controls creativity (lower = more predictable, higher = more creative).
	- **Top-p:** Controls diversity of outputs.

**Image Models (Diffusion):**
- Start with random noise and gradually “denoise” it into a meaningful image, guided by text prompts.
- **Parameters:**
	- **Steps:** Number of denoising steps (more = more detailed).
	- **Guidance scale:** Balances creativity and realism.
	- **Seed:** Controls randomness (same seed = same output).

**Simple Math Intuition:**
- **Discriminative:** Learns $P(y|x)$ (probability of label $y$ given input $x$).
- **Generative:** Learns $P(x, y)$ (joint probability), can generate new $x$.

## 7. Basics of Text Generation
Text generation means creating new sentences, paragraphs, or even stories using AI.

**How it works:**
- The model predicts the next word in a sentence, one word at a time.
- It uses context to make the text coherent and relevant.

**Analogy:** It’s like playing a word game where you have to guess the next word in a story, but the AI is really, really good at it!

**Example:**
> Prompt: "The future of AI is"
>
> Output: "The future of AI is full of exciting possibilities, with machines helping humans solve complex problems."

**Try it yourself:**
- Online demo: [Hugging Face Text Generation](https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=text-generation)
- Python code:
```python
from transformers import pipeline
generator = pipeline("text-generation", model="gpt2")
print(generator("The future of AI is", max_length=30)[0]['generated_text'])
```

## 8. Basics of Image Generation
Image generation means creating new pictures from scratch using AI.

**How it works:**
- The model learns from millions of images and their descriptions.
- You give it a text prompt (e.g., "a cat riding a bicycle"), and it creates a new image that matches the description.

**Analogy:** Imagine describing a picture to a super-fast, super-creative artist who instantly draws it for you.

**Example:**
> Prompt: "A photo of an astronaut riding a horse on Mars"
>
> Output: ![Astronaut riding a horse](https://github.com/CompVis/stable-diffusion/blob/main/assets/stable-samples/txt2img/merged-0006.png?raw=true)

**Try it yourself:**
- Online demo: [Stable Diffusion Demo](https://stablediffusionweb.com/)
- Python code:
```python
from torch import autocast
from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline

pipe = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(
	"CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4", 
	use_auth_token=True
).to("cuda")

prompt = "a photo of an astronaut riding a horse on mars"
with autocast("cuda"):
	image = pipe(prompt)["sample"][0]
	image.save("astronaut_rides_horse.png")
```

## 9. Why is Generative AI Important?
- Generative AI can help you write, design, and create faster than ever before.
- It powers chatbots, creative tools, and even helps scientists discover new drugs.
- It’s a skill that’s in high demand—knowing how to use and understand GenAI can open doors in many careers.
- It raises important questions about ethics, bias, and the future of work.

Experts estimate that generative AI could add $2.6 to $4.4 trillion to the global economy every year (McKinsey, 2023).
